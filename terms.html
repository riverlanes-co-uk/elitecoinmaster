                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">What information do we collect?</h2>
                     <p>We may collect personally identifiable information from you in a variety of ways, including through online forms for ordering products and services, and other instances where you are invited to volunteer such information, including, but not limited to, when you register on our site, place an order or subscribe to our newsletter. When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or credit card information.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">What do we use your information for?</h2>
                     <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience, improve our website, improve customer service, process transactions, send periodic emails. The email address you provide for order processing will only be used to send you information and updates pertaining to your order. If you decide to opt-in to our mailing list, you will receive emails that may include company news, updates, related product or service information, etc. If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">How do we protect your information?</h2>
                     <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or access your personal information.</p>
                     <p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) will not be stored on our servers.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">Payments and refunds</h2>
                     <p>The Site offers products and services for sale. The Site does not handle payments for these products directly but rather refers these payments to a secure third-party payment processor which handles all aspects of the payment process. Any payment issues or disputes should be resolved directly with the payment processor. Once we have been notified by the payment processor that a payment has been made, and that the payment has successfully passed a fraud review, access will be granted to the product or service being purchased as soon as possible, however, we make no guarantees of timeliness or immediacy. Free accounts are provided with limited access to the Site that allows the user to test all available services prior to making a payment and determine if the offered services meet users needs.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">Responsibility of website visitors</h2>
                     <p>By operating the Site, the Operator does not represent or imply that it endorses any or all of the contributed content, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Site may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Operator disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Site.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h2>
                     <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information, except to provide products or services you've requested. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-black text-2xl mb-2 mt-6 font-medium">Copyright infringement and DMCA policy</h2>

If you believe that material located on or linked to by the Site violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify the Operator in accordance with common DMCA policies. The Operator will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. In the case of a visitor who may infringe or repeatedly infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of the Operator or others, the Operator may, in its discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of the Site.
